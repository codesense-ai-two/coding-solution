# Minimum Platforms

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given arrival  **arr[]** and departure  **dep[]** times of trains on the same day, find the minimum number of platforms needed so that no train waits. A platform cannot serve two trains at the same time; if a train arrives before another departs, an extra platform is needed.

 **Note:**  Time intervals are in the 24-hour format  **(**  **HHMM)** , where the first two characters represent hour (between 00 to 23) and the last two characters represent minutes (this will be <= 59 and >= 0). Leading zeros for hours less than 10 are optional (e.g., 0900 is the same as 900).

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800], dep[] = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three trains during the time 9:40 to 12:00. So we need a minimum of 3 platforms.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [900, 1235, 1100], dep[] = [1000, 1240, 1200]
Output: 1
Explanation: All train times are mutually exclusive. So we need only one platform.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [1000, 935, 1100], dep[] = [1200, 1240, 1130]
Output: 3
Explanation: All 3 trains have to be there from 11:00 to 11:30
```

**Constraints:
**1 ≤ number of trains ≤ 105
0000 ≤ arr[i] ≤ dep[i] ≤ 2359

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPlatform(vector<int>& arr, vector<int>& dep) {
        int n = arr.size();

        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        sort(dep.begin(), dep.end());

        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int platforms = 0, ans = 0;

        while (i < n && j < n) {
            if (arr[i] <= dep[j]) {
                platforms++;
                ans = max(ans, platforms);
                i++;
            } else {
                platforms--;
                j++;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
