# 3Sum Closest

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers at  **distinct indices**  in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return  *the sum of the three integers*.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 3 <= nums.length <= 500
- -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
- -104 <= target <= 104

```java
                } else {
                    return sum; // exact match
                }
            }
        }

        return closest;
    }
}

```
